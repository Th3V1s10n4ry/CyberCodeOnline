There seems to be a note with it, "There was rumored to be experimental Caches hanging around, instead of the modern yellow, green, white, or grey caches, you have found this. It's highely dangerous in the hands of an unexperienced person and requires high knowledge to even print with it. With this being a destructive Cache, it can be even more deadly." Maybe you should keep this in mind whenever you have dangerous beings on your tail.
